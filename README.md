## 📅 Learning Progress

### 🟢 Day 01: 🚀 Introduction to Generative AI

See the [Day 01 README](00_Introduction_to_GenAI/Readme.md) for detailed notes and examples.

**Topics Learned:**

-   🔤 **Tokenization with `tiktoken`** → Encoding/decoding text, vocabulary size, token IDs, practical example (_"The cat sat on the mat"_).
-   🤖 **Text Embeddings with OpenAI & Gemini** → Generating embeddings, API setup, Gemini model usage, retrieving embedding vectors.

### 🟢 Day 02: 🔑 Prompt Engineering Basics

See the [Day 02 README](01_Prompting/Readme.md) for detailed notes and examples.

**Topics Learned:**

-   ✍️ **Initial Tokens** → Writing simple human-friendly prompts (_e.g., "Write a code to add two numbers"_).
-   🦙 **Alpaca Prompt Style** → Instruction → Input → Response format.
-   🦙➡️ **LLaMA-2 INST Format** → `[INST] User Prompt [/INST]` with `<<SYS>>` messages.
-   🤖 **ChatML (OpenAI)** → JSON-like role/content prompt structure.
-   🎯 **Prompting Techniques:**
    -   Zero-Shot & Few-Shot prompting
    -   System vs User prompts
    -   Chain of Thought reasoning
    -   Self-Consistency prompting (choose most common answer)
    -   Persona-based prompting (roleplay/character instructions).

# 00: 🚀 Introduction to Generative AI

This directory contains the code examples and materials for **Day 01** of the **GenAI Cohort**, focusing on the fundamentals of Generative AI.

## 📅 Topics Learned (August 19, 2025)

### 1️⃣ Tokenization with `tiktoken`

-   🔤 Learned how to use the **`tiktoken`** library for encoding & decoding text.
-   📊 Understood **vocabulary size** and **token IDs** for GPT-4o.
-   💡 Example: Encoding & decoding the sentence → _"The cat sat on the mat"_.

### 2️⃣ Text Embeddings with OpenAI & Gemini

-   🤖 Used the **OpenAI Python client** to generate embeddings.
-   🔑 Set up **API keys** & **environment variables** for authentication.
-   🧩 Requested embeddings from **Gemini model** (`gemini-embedding-001`).
-   📈 Retrieved & printed **embedding vectors** for input text.
